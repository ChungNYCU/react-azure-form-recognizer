## Overview

In this repository, we provide react components to visualization complex data format. Our goals are reduce user perception time and allow them to modify incorrect value from Microsoft Form Recognizer and extract them as a React props. We also provide accuracy about Microsoft Form Recognizer's result to help users evaluate the service.

## Problem

### Barriers to entry
When faced with Microsoft officail documentation, non-technical users need an easy-to-understand usage example. Integrating services into existing systems is also a challenge when users do not have a technical team.

### Complex information
Microsoft form recognizerâ€™s return data is JSON format. As a non-technical user, JSON format is hard to read and evaluate.

## Solution

We decided to develop reusable components based on the React framework so that users can integrate them into their own systems or websites. Components can visualize results to reduce user perception time, demonstrate accuracy, quantify data, and help users decide whether to use the service.

const [model, setModel] = useState('prebuilt-receipt');
const fileURL = 'https://msftfr.blob.core.windows.net/test/0.png';
const fileIndex = 0;
const displayWidth = 450;
const displayHeight = 800;

const DisplayReceipt = () => (
    <div>
        <FormRecongnizerResultDisplay 
            model={model} fileURL={item} fileIndex={fileIndex} 
            width={displayWidth} height={displayHeight} />
    </div>
  );
```
